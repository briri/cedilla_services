## Cedilla Service Implementation

### CoverThing - An API Cover Art Lookup Service for ISBNs

This is a simple service object that receives JSON citation information from the Cedilla Delivery Aggregator and transforms it into a request to the CoverThing API.

If the API call is successful, the cover_image attribute will be sent back to the Cedilla Delivery Aggregator 

### API provided by LibraryThing - http://www.librarything.com/wiki/index.php/Free_covers
